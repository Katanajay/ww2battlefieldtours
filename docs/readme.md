Primarily and with slight additions like a 'contact form' this site could be used as a tour guides website. There are many tours across the battlefields of europe and is quite lucrative. The site could also be used by a governing body as a reference i.e. a tourist office, again for detailed information on any particular area. 

I have travelled across all these places so the knowledge is genuine and these areas are the best possible locations for museums. 

I imported specific fonts to keep the whole military look and feel. The pseudo elements maps in the background are genuine battle maps of the era and i think they present a nice backdrop rather than a plain white screen. 

I have reduced the volumne of the gunshots, however on some machines it sounds louder please forgive me if this is too loud for you (war is hell ;-) 

I had to speed up my video because it was getting too long, i hope I dont sound like a chipmunk!

Thank you so much for giving me the ability to create a website, I have thouroughly enjoyed this experience.
